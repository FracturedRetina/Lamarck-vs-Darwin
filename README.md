Lamarck-vs-Darwin
=================
Intro
-----
Charles Darwin is one of the most famous scientists in history, and with good reason: he devised the theory that describes how life changes over time. But there was another, lesser known man with the same idea, Jean Baptiste Lamarck. Lamarck’s theory described a kind of evolution that worked in a way different from Darwin’s, and thus Lamarckian evolution has been widely dismissed. But how would this world be different if Lamarck was right? This is the question my experiment was designed to answer.
